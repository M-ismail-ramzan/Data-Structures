# Task 1:
A race is organized among N horses of a kingdom. Every horse has a velocity (in m/sec) that is denoted by
an array Velocity [ ] where Velocity[i] represents the velocity of the ith horse.
All the horses are standing at different starting positions. The starting points are in the same order as the
order of horses in the velocity array. A horse who is standing at ith position is considered to be ahead of
the horse who is standing at position j if and only if i&gt;j.
The finish line of the race is 1000000 meters ahead. Count the number of overtakes that will occur during
the race.
Note: Implement it by using merge sort
Input:
3 2 1 4
Output:
3

# Task 2:
Given an integer array, rearrange it such that it contains positive and negative numbers at
alternate positions. If the array contains more positive or negative elements, move them to the end
of the array.
For example,
Input: {9, -3, 5, -2, -8, -6, 1, 3}
Output: {5, -2, 9, -6, 1, -8, 3, -3}
Hint: Use the partition concept of quick sort
