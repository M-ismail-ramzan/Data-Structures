# Tasks:
## 1. 
Determine whether two string are anagram:
Any word that reproduces the letters in another order is an anagram. X and Y are
anagrams if by rearranging letters of X we will get Y
Examples of anagram
silent = listen
Tom Marvolo Riddle = I am Lord Voldemort
William Shakespeare = I am a weakish speller
incest = insect
Note: Use only 1 Hash table to solve this problem
## 2.
 Sort an array based on order defined by another array in O(n)
Given two integer arrays, reorder elements of the first array by the order of elements
defined by the second array.
The elements that are not present in the second array but present in the first array should
be appended at the end sorted. The second array can contain some extra elements which
are not part of the first array.
Input:
 
first = [5, 8, 9, 3, 5, 7, 1, 3, 4, 9, 3, 5, 1, 8, 4]
second = [3, 5, 7, 2]
 
Output: [3, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 7, 1, 1, 4, 4, 8, 8, 9, 9]
## 3.

 Sets:
a. Find Union and Intersection of 2 sets in O(n)
b. Find all unique pairs of elements in an array that sum to S. For ex. If array =
{2,4,6,4,6} and S = 8 then answer is {(2,6), (4,4)}
