# Function Templates
## Task 1:
 Write the following codes using templates in C++
A and B both can float or integers or any one of them can be integer and the other one can be float
Image!
## Task 2:
Let A and B be two sets: (Data of sets can be integer, double or float)
A = {10.43,4.3,5.61,6.90,11.57,12.11,3.8,2.4,9.5}
B = {11.01,12.34,16.5,3.8,8.1,2.4,9.11,12.11,6.75,10.43,20.2,2.1,4.3}Write
the following functions:
a. Print
Prints all the elements of the array.
b. Union
Find the union of A and B. The union of A and B is the set that contains
those elements that are either in A or in B, or in both
c. Intersection
Find the intersection of A and B. The intersection of A and B is the set that
contains those elements that are in both A and B.
e. Disjoint
Return true if A and B are disjoint sets (sets having no common elements).
f. Find Element
Return True if the Element exists in the set
