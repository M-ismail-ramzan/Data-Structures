# TASK 1

We have discussed the structure and how to access each node of BST in the previous lab.
In this lab we will perform deletion in BST.

delete()
Search for the data item with the user given key and delete it. Remember deletion of
a node can follow three cases.
● Deletion of leaf node
● Deletion of node having one child
● Deletion of node having two children
Make sure you handle all the cases.

# TASK 2

Implement a function height() that finds the height i.e. the maximum depth of a BST.
