### Following are the Assignment Questions
Task 2 : DYNAMIC 2D ARRAY 10 marks
A. Write a program to create a dynamic 2D array (or matrix), i.e., array is created on heap using new
operator. The program gets the following inputs from the user.
Size of the matrix, i.e., number of rows and columns
Values to be stored on each index of the matrix, i.e., ask user to fill the matrix.
Afterwards, the program should display the matrix row-wise and column-wise.
B. Write a program to multiply two matrices and return the resultant matrix.
Note: Array elements should be accessed using pointer notation only.
Task 3: SORTING AND MERGING 15 marks
A. Write a program that takes N integer arrays (of varying sizes) as input. You have to ensure that
user enter these arrays in ascending order, if user enters incorrectly display a prompt to read input
in correct format. Write a C++ program to produce an array that merges elements of all arrays in
descending order, but it also needs to remove duplicates.
Example:
Array A_1: { 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 }
Array A_2: { 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 }
Array A_3: { 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 }
Array A_4: { 23 , 24 , 94 , 108 }
Array A_5: { 1 , 2 , 2 , 23 , 24 , 67 , 1234 }
Merged array: { 1234 , 108 , 94 , 67 , 24 , 23 , 8 , 7 , 6 , 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 }

Note: Final array should be created/merged in sorted order.
Task 4: EMPLOYEE PERFORMANCE REPORTING 20 marks
Write a program that calculates performance based salary of customer support representatives (CSRs)
in an organization:
csrID (Customer support representative ID): An array of seven strings to hold employee
identification numbers. The array should be initialized with the following numbers:
CSR_0 1 , CSR_02, CSR_ 03 , CSR_ 04 , CSR_05, CSR_ 06 , CSR_ 07
csrName: An array to hold the name of each CSR, input at run time
hours: Number of hours worked by each CSR, input at run time
complaintsResolved: Number of complaints successfully resolved by each CSR, input at run time
